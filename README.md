# What?
Interactive Script to cut a Photoshop Document into tiles usable for a Custom Map Type with the Google Maps API v3


# How?
See the example/ dir for a photoshop File, the tiles created by the script and the necessary code to define the custom map type

The Custom Map Type for flat images needs a custom non Mercator Projection to have a unified way of placing Markers and move the map to specific pixel positions more accurately
